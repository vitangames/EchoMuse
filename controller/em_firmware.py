"""
em_firmware.py — on-disk cache of downloaded device firmware.

`_fetch_binary` opened a fresh HTTP session and pulled the whole release asset
on every call, from both OTA paths. Updating a fleet therefore downloaded the
same ~10MB once per device, and the provisioning wizard downloaded it again for
every device it set up. On a slow or metered connection that is the slowest
part of a fleet update, and it is entirely avoidable: the artefact is immutable
— a published release tag never changes what it points at.

**md5 is the definition of a cache hit, not the file existing.** A truncated
download is the realistic failure here (an interrupted transfer leaves a file
of plausible size), and the OTA's own device-side verification cannot catch it:
that check confirms the device received what the controller SENT, so a corrupt
cache entry verifies perfectly all the way onto the device — and a corrupt
binary and a genuinely broken one produce the same observable, three fast exits
and a rollback. So the digest is written beside the payload and re-checked on
every read, which costs ~30ms against a 10MB file.

**A cache failure is never an update failure.** Every write path degrades to
"return the bytes anyway": the cache is an optimisation, and a full or
read-only disk must not stop a device being updated. That is the opposite of
the rule for the DB backup before a migration, and deliberately so — there,
refusing is the safe action; here, refusing costs the user the thing they asked
for and protects nothing.
