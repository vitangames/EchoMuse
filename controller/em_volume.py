"""Volume scale conversion between the device's native level and HA's float.

Split out as pure logic for the reason em_linkauth.py was: the three call
sites (em_controller, em_esphome, em_api) each had their OWN copy of
`level / 175`, so the scale lived in three places and none of them were
covered by a test. Changing the ceiling meant finding all three.

The device level is the raw tinymix ctl 61 index — the tlv320aic32x4 DAC
digital volume, 0.5dB per step with 0dB (unity) at index 127. The scale is
therefore dB-linear, which is roughly perceptually linear, so the mapping to
HA's 0.0–1.0 is a plain proportion and needs no extra taper.

DEVICE_VOLUME_MAX is 127 and NOT the control's own maximum of 175. Indexes
above 127 apply positive digital gain to near-full-scale PCM and saturate
inside the DAC — measured at 65% THD by index 153 (see
device/internal/server/volume.go for the full measurement and why stock
FireOS never touches this control).
